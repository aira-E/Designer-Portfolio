          <h1> DOST Website Revamp </h1>
          <p> The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) website is not just your ordinary government website; it serves as a central hub connecting 16 regional offices and 6 service institutes, each with its own separate website. While this decentralized structure allows different offices to manage their own content, it also creates navigation and other user experiences challenges </p>

          <h2> Project Background </h2>
          <p className="project_background"> The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) website serves as a central hub connecting 16
            regional offices and 6 service institutes, each with its own separate website. While this decentralized
            structure allows different offices to manage their own content, it also creates navigation and other user
            experience challenges. </p>
          <p> The website has the potential to be a powerful and accessible platform, but its current design and
              functionality limit its effectiveness. If its features were better optimized and tailored to user needs, the
              website could reach its full potential as a centralized and efficient digital hub for
              science and technology-related services </p>
