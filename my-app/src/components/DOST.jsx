                    <ul>
                        <li> Unmoderated testing was applied to task-based activities, allowing users to explore both websites freely while the researcher observed their behavior. </li>
                        <li> Moderated testing was used when introducing new features (personal account, auto-fill, AI chatbot), as users were unfamiliar with the proposed design. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Participants were balanced between remote and in-person setups: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 2 remote users (affiliated with DOST) were assumed to be more familiar with the site. </li>
                        <li> 2 in-person users (not affiliated with DOST) used their own devices. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Observing them helped capture first-time reactions and provided opportunities for guidance when needed. </p>

                <div className="content_specific">
                    <h3> Sampling Method </h3>
                    <p> The researcher intentionally selected 2 DOST-affiliated participants (e.g., scholars, innovators) as they represent the platform's primary users. Additionally, 2 non-DOST participants (e.g., educator, government employee) were included to capture perspectives from potential users who may benefit from the services. </p>
                    <p> This purposive sampling approach ensures relevance to the website’s intended use cases and user groups.</p>

                                <p> Additionally, respondents recommended adding: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Having multiple roles. For a more accurate personalization, demanding, “Ako teacher ako, pero at the same time student and researcher din” </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Hence, the researcher concludes that creating an account should remain optional to accommodate different user needs. However, whether or not a user has an account, the website’s content must remain cohesive, accessible, and user-friendly.
                                    Additionally, the user may pick multiple user roles and makes the changing of the roles availble from time to time to a more updated and personalized user experience</p>

                        <li> In web application system to lessen anchored links </li>
                            <p> All users appreciated the presence of an application system on the website for various reasons: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Reduces Errors. Users preferred a “form” type setup, with one stating: “Siguro doon ako mas sanay, tapos nalalaman mo pa kung saan ka may kulang or nagkamali, kasi ‘di ba kapag online form may indication.” </li>
                                <li> More Direct. Respondents noted that the process felt more straightforward, reducing reliance on anchored links and minimizing clicks. One mentioned: “Dire-diretso na.” </li>
                                <li> Sets Expectations. One user emphasized the progress bar included on the design when filling out forms, stating: “Ang tagal-tagal parang hindi natatapos,” suggesting that visual feedback helps manage their expectations. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> Additionally, respondents recommended adding: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> An anonymous option for sensitive complaint applications, </li>
                                <li> A confirmation message to serve as proof of submission, and </li>
                                <li> A tracker or status update feature to notify users of their application progress. </li>
                                <li> A video demo to provide more guidance to the user </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li> Auto-fill feature on forms for multiple submission </li>
                            <p> All users initially overlooked the “Auto-fill” button, with one respondent suggesting that its color may have made it less noticeable.

                                Half of the respondents (2/4) quickly recognized that the form on the website was based on the CSC Form 212 (Revised 2017) - Personal Data Sheet, and both appreciated this reference as it made the process easier. One respondent remarked, “Maganda ‘to, kasi ang mga tao tamad,” implying that the feature supports users by simplifying repetitive tasks. Another user added, “Paulit-ulit nagfi-fill-up every time mag-apply ka. Nakakapagod,” emphasizing how the feature reduces redundancy.

                                However, one user raised concerns about privacy, expressing that while autofill is helpful, some users might hesitate if they feel the website has access to their personal information. She suggested including a prompt or message acknowledging the use of their data and clearly referencing the Data Privacy Act, to ensure transparency and user consent.

                        <li> AI Chatbot for a faster customer service </li>
                            <p> All users appreciated the chatbot’s design and animation, which made it easily noticeable.
                                Preferences for using an AI chatbot versus contacting customer service varied based on urgency and context: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> User 1 preferred the chatbot for faster responses and only consulted people if necessary. </li>
                                <li> User 2 chose between customer service or AI depending on the nature of the concern. He also gave example that he called customer service regarding his delayed stipend. </li>
                                <li> User 3 explored the website first, then used the chatbot, and only resorted to calling or emailing if needed. </li>
                                <li> User 4 preferred talking to a person for concerns but used the chatbot for general website info. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> One user highlighted the chatbot's role in improving navigation efficiency, saying, “Mabilis mag-provide ng info. It could help sa efficiency sa pag-navigate,” noting that such features make a website stand out. However, one user suggested that the chatbot should save previous queries to avoid re-entering concerns every visit. </p>

                    <p> The researcher suggests to implement the following for future development: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Inclusive Design </li>
                        <p> Since one of the participant is visually impaired, it is hard for them to read some of the texts. In consideration also to our PWD sector </p>
                        <li> Scholarship Specific Page </li>
                        <p> Since most of the traffic is present in this area. It is suggested that the website will have a specific page for the scholarships. </p>
